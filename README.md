Codes for ongoing project on global trade interconnectedness

Using information from the Directory of Trade Statistics (DOTS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) we apply network analysis to 490,429 yearly bilateral trade flows between 206 jurisdictions across the 2000-2020 period. Building on the groundwork set by Errico & Massara (2011) we study the structural evolution of the global trade network and compute a composite interconnectedness index using 13 measures of strength and centrality for each jurisdiction's external sector.

A 2021 paper based on this work was awarded with the 2021 Pola Ortiz Prize for Excellence for professors and researchers at UCAB School of Economics. Original text in Spanish.
